## Recommendation
what the recommendation is.

## How to or examples
how to do it. 

### File and image links
Example of how to create a link: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/966.pdf">link to 966.pdf</a>.

~~~~
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/files/966.pdf">link to 966.pdf</a>. 
~~~~~

This example uses HTML, and tildes. Seems to me that tokens should not be replaced in a code block. If they are, look a the source. You can also use markdown shortcuts. see the kramdown quick ref.

Steps
1. commit the file to the files dir
1. create link using site.baseurl


Example of a how to include an image. Same process, use the images dir and site.baseurl:
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/EDI-logo-svg-240.png" alt="EDI logo" height="80" width="80"/>

~~~
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/EDI-logo-svg-240.png" alt="EDI logo" height="80" width="80"/>
~~~~

### Code blocks
put code examples in code blocks
~~~~~
simplest way to do a code block is to surround by defined by tildes.
~~
Ending lines must have at least as
many tildes as the starting line. 
~~~~~~~~~~~


Code block with language specified uses backticks:
``` ruby
def what?
  42
end
```
