### Introduction
This repository contains basic files for creating project documentation that can be easily served using github pages. 


### Get Started

[Create a new post](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) using one of the categories listed in `_config.yml`. It will appear in the navigation on the left once recompiled. 



#### Don't Forget

- For the entire site, `title` and `subtitle` are defined in `config.yml` 
- This page (i.e. `index.md`) is the index page. Edit the `title`
- pages are in the `_posts` dir, with navigation and page metadata controlled by the top-matter
- filenames in `_posts` should follow the convention of yyyy-mm-dd-title-string.md
- Set the `baseurl` in `_config.yml` for your repo if deploying to GitHub pages (e.g, this test repo's baseurl is "documentation_test3"
