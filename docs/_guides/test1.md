This is part of a Guides collection 

the front matter is out of date 
per this guy: https://ben.balter.com/2015/02/20/jekyll-collections/ 

If you are using posts for things that are not grouped by date, you're using them wrong.

### TO DO: 
1. learn how to use collections. including subdirs. I think you can do guides/subdir/file.html
1. figure out how to generate an index for the subdir. see academic-pages. they do it. with excerpts.
1. learn now to render locally, so you don't have to push to github all the time. your mac does this with BON, so ought to work here, too.  


### The below material applies only to posts:
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.
